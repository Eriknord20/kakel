// slotKindPassphrase is a slot opened by something the user knows

// Every other slot is an SSH key, which is the whole of how this vault
// is opened and the whole of how it is lost: a user whose keys are all
// gone has no way back in, and copying the file does not help, because
// the copy wants the same keys. A passphrase slot is the way back.
//
// It is a weaker door and it is meant to be the second one. An ed25519
// key is a hundred and twenty-eight bits in a file; a passphrase is
// what somebody typed, and anybody holding this file can guess at it
// for as long as they like with nothing to stop them but the cost of
// each guess. Nothing adds one. The user asks for it, and is told that
// before they do.

// raises them and meets one written by this one.
