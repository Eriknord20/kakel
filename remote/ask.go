// cancelled. They are called from the goroutine that is connecting,
// never from the one drawing, so an implementation has to hand the
// question to the window and wait for the reply.
//
// Returning an error stops the connection, and the error is what the
// caller is told. That is what cancelling a dialog means: the user said
// no, so nothing else is tried and no second question is asked.
