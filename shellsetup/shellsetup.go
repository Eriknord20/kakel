// A shell is a separate program, and kakel only sees the bytes it
// prints. So it cannot know which directory the shell is in, or where
// one command's output ends and the next begins, unless the shell says
// so. The shell says so by printing escape sequences nobody sees: OSC 7
// for the directory, OSC 133 around each command.
//
// The lines here are typed into the shell as soon as it starts, the way
// a user would type them. That is the one way that works everywhere: on
// a server the login shell is started by sshd and kakel never sees a
// command line to add to.
